today is one\\n0:07 of such events if you want to find out\\n0:09 more about the events we have there is a\\n0:11 link in the description go there check\\n0:13 it out and see what you like do not\\n0:16 forget to subscribe to our YouTube\\n0:17 channel this way you will get notified\\n0:20 about amazing live streams like we have\\n0:23 today and we have a very cool slack\\n0:26 Community where you can hang out with\\n0:27 other data enthusiasts and one of the\\n0:31 things we have in slack is an amazing\\n0:33 initiative Adonis is one of those who\\n0:37 organize a lot of things there called\\n0:39 project of the week and we're just\\n0:41 finishing wrapping up\\n0:43 a week about learning rust so check it\\n0:46 out it's an amazing Community project of\\n0:48 the week is really a cool thing if you\\n0:50 don't know about that there is a channel\\n0:51 called project of the week\\n0:54 um yeah during today's interview you can\\n0:57 ask any question you want there is a\\n0:59 Pinter Link in the live chat\\n1:00 just click on that link ask your\\n1:02 question and I will be covering these\\n1:05 questions during video\\n1:06 now I will stop sharing my screen\\n1:09 I went off script a little bit you've\\n1:12 probably noticed yeah and I will now\\n1:15 open the document that we Johanna\\n1:19 prepare for you\\n1:21 and\\n1:23 yeah where it is\\n1:26 and I guess we can start if you're ready\\n1:29 yep\\n1:30 okay\\n1:31 this week we'll talk about\\n1:33 freelancing and working at a startup\\n1:36 that we have special guests today Adonis\\n1:38 Adonis is a freelance data scientist who\\n1:40 is currently working at animatrix which\\n1:43 is a startup that is focusing on\\n1:45 providing software for Nana product\\n1:48 inspection that sounds really cool in\\n1:50 addition he recently joined a freelance\\n1:53 platform called upwork where he offers a\\n1:56 range of data solutions to clients\\n1:58 so welcome to the show\\n2:01 hi nice thank you for the intention and\\n2:04 nice to be here\\n2:05 yeah and what I did not have in the\\n2:09 script but Adonis actually is a very\\n2:12 very active member of data talks Club\\n2:13 Community and it's a real pleasure for\\n2:15 me to have him here today so thanks for\\n2:18 joining us today\\n2:21 and yeah so the questions for today's\\n2:23 interview are as always prepared by\\n2:25 Johanna buyer thanks a lot Johanna for\\n2:27 your help\\n2:28 and before we go into our main topic of\\n2:31 freelancing and working at the startup\\n2:33 let's start with your background can you\\n2:36 tell us about your journey so far\\n2:38 yeah so yeah I'll start with my bachelor\\n2:42 um I studied Applied Mathematics in\\n2:45 physics that's my main degree actually I\\n2:47 also focused on the on the physics uh\\n2:50 Direction\\n2:52 so I graduated as a physicist and then I\\n2:55 continued to do a master in Greece again\\n2:58 master and Barcelona in Greece uh that\\n3:02 was on nano technology\\n3:05 and there uh while I was doing my theses\\n3:08 I started working uh that was like\\n3:11 around 2017 I started working with data\\n3:15 science like it was because of my thesis\\n3:17 and after that I went to the Netherlands\\n3:21 to join a program that was that is\\n3:24 called a professional doctorate in\\n3:25 engineering\\n3:27 and uh there uh yeah you work for the\\n3:30 University and then the university sends\\n3:32 you do projects with companies around\\n3:34 Netherlands so you do those projects you\\n3:37 get exposure to Industry and also you\\n3:41 getting modules and trainings from the\\n3:44 University so it's like a combination\\n3:47 your education\\n3:49 yeah yeah so it's education and when\\n3:52 working with Center so it's the first\\n3:53 year you work as a kind of consultant\\n3:56 for a company doing small projects like\\n4:00 four month three months and then the\\n4:02 second year you they send you and do\\n4:03 like a one year contract with a company\\n4:07 um if you work there you provide Your\\n4:08 solution that is their problem and also\\n4:10 you get the training or kind of whatever\\n4:12 you need a specialist from the\\n4:14 University\\n4:15 so after that\\n4:17 I joined I became like a freelancer in\\n4:21 Greece I came back to Greece became a\\n4:22 freelancer and uh yeah my first job was\\n4:26 actually the reason I mostly agenda\\n4:29 getting back to Greece was for the\\n4:30 startup called nanometrices\\n4:32 uh where uh yeah as you told yeah what\\n4:36 we do is like rebuilding um software for\\n4:39 companies who are building Nano products\\n4:41 we help them inspect those because there\\n4:43 is a lot of complexity there and if\\n4:45 somebody doesn't want to invest their\\n4:47 money all the time or a team on uh\\n4:50 finding these metrics uh that uh\\n4:56 are characterizing uh Nano product\\n4:59 structure it's very complicated and yeah\\n5:02 if somebody doesn't want to do that we\\n5:04 offer them our software which can lift\\n5:07 this kind of further north\\n5:09 and uh yeah after while I was doing that\\n5:12 I because I was technically a freelancer\\n5:14 in Greece I was I joined the upwork uh\\n5:17 the platform which for Freelancers and I\\n5:20 was providing their solutions for muscle\\n5:21 learning data science\\n5:23 so that's happening right now\\n5:26 that's a cool Journey so what are those\\n5:29 Nana products like are there\\n5:31 like is it related to electronics like\\n5:33 uh phones and stuff yeah so actually\\n5:37 yeah one of the Nano products or clients\\n5:40 that we have\\n5:42 um has uh they're building services and\\n5:46 the nanoscale that you cannot see with\\n5:47 your eyes you need a special machine to\\n5:50 see them\\n5:51 electrons not light\\n5:54 um and these surfaces are the base for\\n5:58 the chips that we're using our phones on\\n6:00 our laptop\\n6:03 um also apart from that there are uh\\n6:06 some uh ages you know that we have for\\n6:09 erasers\\n6:11 so even the edges of the razors have to\\n6:13 be have to have a very specific\\n6:17 how to have a roughness a specific\\n6:19 roughness on there so so they can be\\n6:22 effective and uh you know at the hair\\n6:24 only uh and then there are non-particles\\n6:27 we can be on the uh creams that we put\\n6:30 in our face so they have to have\\n6:31 specific sizes\\n6:33 so there's a big variety\\n6:35 of nanoproduction it's keep growing\\n6:38 so I only knew about the the chips part\\n6:42 uh but I had no idea about razors and\\n6:45 these nanoparticles that's pretty\\n6:47 interesting they never realized that\\n6:49 razors are such a complex thing yeah\\n6:52 okay we can just uh\\n6:54 you know sharp thing that he used to\\n6:57 compare yeah it was a very like\\n7:00 complicated and a lot of science behind\\n7:03 it\\n7:04 I know that Philips\\n7:07 um like the the razor I use is a big\\n7:11 company in the Netherlands is it like\\n7:13 did you did you get any exposure to\\n7:16 these things that Philips did you work\\n7:17 at Phillips in any way\\n7:20 not in physics and not the Phillips\\n7:23 other people did uh but uh\\n7:26 uh yeah I had another other companies\\n7:29 like HTML which is also like a uh was an\\n7:33 old spin spin-off or spin out I think\\n7:35 from Phillips but uh there were people\\n7:37 who did projects with Phillips\\n7:40 as I heard about programs like the one\\n7:42 you had and he usually like Philips\\n7:45 invests a lot of money thanks I think\\n7:48 one of the universities did you studied\\n7:50 the Eindhoven University yeah yeah so\\n7:54 actually uh it it is in a from Eindhoven\\n7:58 and there's also a joint program from\\n8:00 delft and\\n8:07 anyways so you finished your program you\\n8:11 came back to Greece and you decided to\\n8:13 work at a startup\\n8:15 so how did it happen why startup why not\\n8:17 join a corporation\\n8:19 yeah so\\n8:22 yeah I I had an opportunity to either\\n8:24 work for a corporation uh kind of\\n8:27 recuperation was I think open was the\\n8:29 snc maybe you know it luck uh yeah there\\n8:33 was uh I had the opportunity either to\\n8:36 work there or to work on the startup I\\n8:39 had like both offers around the same\\n8:41 time\\n8:43 so\\n8:45 the things that\\n8:47 I was yeah I had like after I graduate\\n8:51 after I graduated I finished the program\\n8:53 I had a lot of time and I was doing uh\\n8:57 the interviews and I had you know\\n8:58 rejections of the all the process and\\n9:02 then at the same time I had those two\\n9:03 workers so I was thinking my head okay\\n9:05 what I want like I had to stop and think\\n9:07 like uh\\n9:10 for many days and uh\\n9:13 yeah I decided that uh I would like to\\n9:16 try I always admire you know the the\\n9:19 journey like entrepreneurship journey\\n9:20 and creating something Innovative and uh\\n9:24 push it in the market and see okay how\\n9:26 it goes getting feedback all this kind\\n9:28 of\\n9:29 um\\n9:31 parts of you know the startup and they\\n9:33 always admired you know started stories\\n9:35 so I said okay I'm gonna do it now and\\n9:38 if something doesn't go well or maybe I\\n9:40 have other opportunities\\n9:42 to to go to a corporation oh and also by\\n9:45 the way yeah the startup was doing what\\n9:48 I was doing in the master and I would do\\n9:50 something in data science which I don't\\n9:51 think would be very\\n9:53 easy\\n9:54 yeah\\n9:55 so in your Masters you were doing some\\n9:58 Nano product stuff already\\n10:00 yeah\\n10:02 okay so it was uh quite related so you\\n10:05 were interested in this in this Nano\\n10:07 products you were interested in data\\n10:09 science and it was the uh kind of the\\n10:12 best thing like\\n10:14 two together\\n10:16 yeah yeah yeah\\n10:18 okay that's pretty interesting and when\\n10:20 you were deciding to be in startup and\\n10:23 Corporation I think probably there were\\n10:26 also some good side good things about\\n10:29 you know joining the corporation right\\n10:31 did you do some sort of I don't know\\n10:34 like for example when I need to make a\\n10:36 decision sometimes what I do is I list\\n10:37 pros and cons and then I see okay like\\n10:40 there are more prompts Pros here than\\n10:42 console then this is\\n10:44 like the decision they take did you do\\n10:46 something like this when deciding\\n10:48 exactly I did exactly uh like that and I\\n10:52 also was trying I I cut down all the I\\n10:55 was not telling anyone about this so I\\n10:58 cut off everyone's you know kind of\\n11:00 opinion that might affect you there was\\n11:02 me and myself let's say and I was yeah\\n11:04 trying to balance this uh the pros and\\n11:08 cons you definitely get some pros from\\n11:11 working on a corporation and you know\\n11:13 some cones and uh yeah I said let's try\\n11:17 the startup Direction\\n11:20 um I I thought they would give me some\\n11:22 more value maybe in the future I will\\n11:24 you know go back to the corporate\\n11:27 environment to get something there\\n11:29 or maybe startup becomes a preparation\\n11:32 oh yeah that's uh also a good not good\\n11:36 as well\\n11:38 yeah and like do you remember what what\\n11:41 were this pros and console for pros\\n11:43 working for a startup I think you\\n11:45 mentioned like you know creating\\n11:46 something Innovative and then like other\\n11:49 things\\n11:50 do you remember what were the\\n11:52 you know other things you put in when\\n11:55 decided\\n11:56 yeah\\n11:57 um\\n11:59 I think with a with a corporate\\n12:02 environment okay they're always\\n12:03 exceptions okay but uh\\n12:06 your kind of more Focus to your job that\\n12:10 is in your description\\n12:12 um\\n12:13 but in in a startup you might take other\\n12:16 positions as well because you're not so\\n12:18 many people so you have to yeah you have\\n12:21 to maybe talk to clients or you have to\\n12:24 do The Branding uh maybe you have to\\n12:27 make a video about your company that\\n12:29 okay\\n12:30 like so many things that the there might\\n12:33 be uh somebody else's job in a corporate\\n12:36 uh incorporate environment so and I\\n12:40 think that for some person could be can\\n12:44 put it in the console put it on the uh\\n12:46 on the pros you know depending on what\\n12:49 they like to do and for you was it the\\n12:52 pro or cons I think it for me was a kind\\n12:55 of Pros yeah I wanted to have the\\n12:57 ability to of course to go a bit to the\\n13:00 also the business so part of it or other\\n13:03 aspects of it to control it to control\\n13:05 them\\n13:07 and they actually need to record videos\\n13:09 now\\n13:12 um no I hadn't uh not just but I built a\\n13:14 website\\n13:17 it's cool\\n13:18 some people in the in my company have\\n13:22 made videos like in the recorded them\\n13:25 and post them you know for branding\\n13:28 um\\n13:29 yeah but I think also a one pro I could\\n13:33 definitely think and I want that\\n13:37 in the startup is like you you are more\\n13:40 organized by\\n13:42 kind of nature like you have to be\\n13:45 organized more in\\n13:48 in the AI corporate environment in a\\n13:51 startup you have yourself to do that\\n13:55 maybe it has to do a bit with\\n13:57 accountability as well so yeah you're\\n14:01 yourself you're accountable while in the\\n14:03 in the company it's more easy to be\\n14:06 somebody else so you had\\n14:08 deadlines by your manager or your team\\n14:11 but with a startups you put in your\\n14:14 deadlines or you maybe yeah your clients\\n14:16 depends\\n14:18 so yeah that's that would be as well\\n14:20 something different\\n14:22 how large is the company where you work\\n14:25 uh\\n14:28 how large is the company where you work\\n14:29 we are um for active people yeah for\\n14:34 four okay\\n14:37 that's a pretty small startup\\n14:39 yeah I don't know yeah I see I think\\n14:43 startups with two people so like yeah\\n14:46 startups with one two one people right\\n14:49 yeah yeah that's true yeah in\\n14:52 accelerator that we have\\n14:54 there were some that uh it was just one\\n14:57 person\\n14:57 like building two things I was like okay\\n15:01 yeah so four people and then if you're\\n15:04 one of these four you have to do pretty\\n15:05 much everything right so yeah yeah yeah\\n15:08 for me it was uh now we were in an\\n15:11 accelerator and uh was getting a lot of\\n15:13 business uh we were Christian of\\n15:16 business argument let's say uh because\\n15:18 we were coming actually from academic\\n15:20 mindset the the the\\n15:23 nanomaticists started that is the\\n15:26 spin-off uh from a research center in\\n15:28 Greece so yeah I myself had to get this\\n15:33 kind of knowledge a lot and Country Door\\n15:37 yeah\\n15:38 to to the company\\n15:41 yeah what did you since you joined what\\n15:44 kind of new skills have you learned\\n15:46 working at a startup\\n15:49 and yeah\\n15:51 so I think\\n15:54 the communication how to be better\\n15:59 communicating with the team\\n16:03 um because I was kind of not exactly the\\n16:07 only data scientist\\n16:08 when I was building something I had to\\n16:11 translate it\\n16:13 with not so many complicated technical\\n16:17 uh you know words to other people\\n16:21 um also maybe to some clients or\\n16:24 managers or CEOs and other clients so\\n16:27 communication skills as well definitely\\n16:29 it was yeah and this was just an example\\n16:33 another thing for me was business\\n16:35 knowledge\\n16:36 I learned I'm still learning I have a a\\n16:41 lot a lot more to go\\n16:44 um\\n16:45 and I think\\n16:48 yeah because again I was accountable for\\n16:52 myself and for the client I had to\\n16:54 increase\\n16:56 more of my quality of uh you know my\\n17:00 product or my\\n17:02 uh my code\\n17:05 still is not on the level that I want\\n17:08 but yeah I'm doing and a lot of learning\\n17:11 you know you have to be able to learn\\n17:15 things on your own\\n17:18 um\\n17:19 yeah and being kind of yeah the other\\n17:22 thing that was was talking to you or\\n17:25 yeah I was talking about like I wasn't\\n17:27 the blog about being lean that's uh that\\n17:30 was a big thing for me uh like there\\n17:33 they're kind of the lean way to work\\n17:35 what is uh what is a lean way to work\\n17:39 yeah so\\n17:41 um\\n17:42 yeah it comes from the fact that we\\n17:44 don't uh\\n17:46 uh we cannot make very accurate\\n17:49 predictions of something that will be\\n17:52 able to publish or how it will go so we\\n17:55 built the product and that was that\\n17:58 product was built on assumptions\\n18:00 okay\\n18:01 so uh okay if it's the physics and or\\n18:06 maybe I should send something to space I\\n18:08 know it's very complicated but there the\\n18:10 rules are\\n18:11 can be predictable because okay there\\n18:14 are masses and you can't rewrite some\\n18:17 things uh in the note and predict where\\n18:20 the next second maybe the specific goal\\n18:23 but uh okay of course it's complicated\\n18:27 at some other parts but yeah but when\\n18:30 you launch a product or even you launch\\n18:31 a new model uh it's um you have to uh\\n18:36 you you do this on based on assumptions\\n18:38 and you have to test them that's the\\n18:40 thing you have to test them as soon as\\n18:41 possible and from the test that you get\\n18:43 you get a feedback right see this this\\n18:47 thing works this thing didn't work I\\n18:49 made a prediction that um\\n18:52 my side who sells cars uh I'm selling\\n18:56 more I'm trying to push more red cars to\\n18:58 sell them because I think people like\\n19:00 red\\n19:01 cars more I have to test this this is my\\n19:05 best idea right now like my Innovative\\n19:07 idea I have to test it I tried it out\\n19:08 yeah it didn't work I saw um yeah I have\\n19:12 to Pivot you know try to do something\\n19:13 different so\\n19:16 this the leanway is based on like this\\n19:19 circle but called the build you build\\n19:21 something you measure it\\n19:23 and then you learn from it and then you\\n19:25 do build again and you do this looks\\n19:27 trying to because again\\n19:30 you cannot know you cannot predict\\n19:32 everything\\n19:35 so there is an idea you think that this\\n19:38 idea is going to work you need to find a\\n19:40 way to test this idea right and then you\\n19:42 need to have a way to measure this idea\\n19:45 like do people really buy\\n19:48 more cars if we have more red cars\\n19:50 something like that right and then you\\n19:52 say okay I can give people buy more or\\n19:53 like nothing changes right and then this\\n19:56 gives you some idea that you can\\n19:58 you know I to change your assumptions or\\n20:02 maybe develop them\\n20:03 right yeah development further I don't\\n20:07 know yeah yeah and that can go with uh\\n20:10 you know that was a startup example but\\n20:12 it goes definitely well with the machine\\n20:15 learning or data data machine learning\\n20:20 process sorry or a data product\\n20:23 so it seems like it's something that\\n20:26 will work in other environments too not\\n20:29 just the stuff okay like a corporation\\n20:32 too\\n20:34 yeah well I think uh in the end that uh\\n20:38 that's something uh that they do and\\n20:42 yeah maybe even actually the the book\\n20:44 that I was reading about this The Lean\\n20:47 Startup was called the book I was saying\\n20:49 in the beginning that it's not only for\\n20:51 startups don't uh yeah uh it's for\\n20:55 everyone like for for companies for uh\\n20:58 yeah\\n20:59 right for I mean like yeah maybe life\\n21:02 like uh\\n21:04 in in machine learning you know you make\\n21:07 assumption about when you publish a\\n21:09 model how would it go based on the\\n21:11 training and data set that you're having\\n21:13 the testing but then when you publish it\\n21:16 uh things might change and the one\\n21:19 aspect that people think right now\\n21:21 discuss a lot and you have it in the\\n21:23 mlops\\n21:25 course is the monitoring right and there\\n21:29 are things drift like you have data\\n21:32 drift or concept drift\\n21:35 um and uh\\n21:36 yeah I mean like you have to monitor\\n21:39 them and see whether your model or the\\n21:42 assumptions change I mean like tools\\n21:44 like I think you have the evidently\\n21:47 um yeah definitely I can it would be\\n21:50 useful to to have them\\n21:53 and for those who do not know Adonis now\\n21:56 is talking about the ml Ops course the\\n21:59 free course that started\\n22:01 last week so we are still on module one\\n22:05 and by the time the recording is out we\\n22:07 will probably be on module like 3 PB but\\n22:11 yeah you can check it out I think there\\n22:13 should be a link in the description to\\n22:15 this video too\\n22:16 and maybe I actually wanted to talk to\\n22:20 you about that a little bit later\\n22:22 but before starting the stream I asked\\n22:26 you when you joined data talks Club so\\n22:28 maybe you can tell us a bit more about\\n22:29 that because you're a really active\\n22:31 member of our community and it's a very\\n22:34 interesting to hear your story like how\\n22:36 did it happen that you joined our\\n22:38 community\\n22:40 all right yeah so I had a friend who's\\n22:43 also was in the program in Antelope\\n22:45 Leonard and uh yeah I was we were\\n22:48 talking about courses it's like\\n22:50 discussing okay I wanna I was telling\\n22:52 him hey I want to check out uh I had\\n22:54 more courses because I think I'm weak on\\n22:56 some topics and he said okay I know like\\n23:00 Alexei or data talks lab is this you can\\n23:03 check it out they have the back then was\\n23:05 I think December he was telling me about\\n23:07 that you had the data engineering of\\n23:10 course I was like okay yeah I will check\\n23:12 it out and I was a bit late joint so I\\n23:15 did enjoy the the engineering course\\n23:17 that you had I think it was maybe the\\n23:20 first the engineering that you what you\\n23:22 had there and\\n23:24 um I was I didn't know you know about\\n23:26 the concept of the slack or the talks\\n23:30 that you had so I wasn't sure what it is\\n23:32 uh um and I was as the time was passing\\n23:36 the month were passing I was seeing the\\n23:38 maybe the talks so I was might taking\\n23:40 some of the talks that you had the\\n23:42 interviews you know and then I was\\n23:44 taking more the slug\\n23:45 so\\n23:48 I slowly kind of understood what was\\n23:52 happening in slack and the whole\\n23:54 community so I said okay I'll join the\\n23:57 Emma lost when it was a chance I really\\n23:59 liked it I definitely liked the fact\\n24:02 that people were posting the questions\\n24:04 or talking about envelopes like it was\\n24:08 something I realized that I didn't have\\n24:11 um first okay in my startup you know I\\n24:13 was\\n24:14 the scientists alone there kind of\\n24:18 um and uh it was fascinating to see you\\n24:21 know people from around the world\\n24:22 talking about you know data and\\n24:24 something new that was happening\\n24:27 and also learn you know from the\\n24:30 learn something new\\n24:31 and uh yeah after that there was uh I\\n24:36 wanted to be you know more active as so\\n24:38 that I liked apart from yeah being in\\n24:41 the community maybe I could do something\\n24:43 smaller my own like you you suggested\\n24:47 the the project of the week so yeah\\n24:51 yeah that's really cool to have you here\\n24:53 and it's a nice to hear your story so\\n24:56 you try to do data engineering course\\n24:58 then like you've learned like it was a\\n25:02 bit late I guess or you will yeah you\\n25:05 did the envelopes one right yeah that\\n25:07 was the first one yeah\\n25:09 do you remember what your project was\\n25:10 about\\n25:12 yeah my\\n25:14 I chose like a semiconductor\\n25:17 uh project I don't remember I was I was\\n25:20 predicting right now yeah uh but I was\\n25:22 there was a lot of features and I was\\n25:24 trying to I was in machine learning\\n25:26 model I was I think predicting as the\\n25:28 fault of uh if uh the chip is gonna fail\\n25:32 or not I'm not not sure but uh\\n25:36 uh yeah I had the opportunity to\\n25:40 um yeah do usml flow\\n25:44 um I would say I had I had I didn't in\\n25:47 the past\\n25:49 um check the check out the you know\\n25:51 grafana and Luis\\n25:53 uh evidently Ai and also use a yeah uh\\n25:59 prefect perfect it was was a very nice\\n26:02 alternative for me personally to\\n26:05 workflow\\n26:07 I would like for me it was for the\\n26:09 things I wanted to build was much easier\\n26:11 so\\n26:12 yeah I I had the opportunity you know to\\n26:15 use them all uh kind of as you did in\\n26:19 the\\n26:20 in the course but uh yeah all of them\\n26:23 together for a course it was a big\\n26:25 learning the the you're having a project\\n26:26 definitely it was the best thing in the\\n26:29 end for uh\\n26:31 you know you know getting the knowledge\\n26:34 installed in your head\\n26:37 okay do you have any suggestions for the\\n26:39 students who just start the summer Labs\\n26:41 course\\n26:43 yeah\\n26:44 um I think uh it's first to\\n26:49 um to yeah check for sure the those for\\n26:53 sure the\\n26:54 exercises in the end\\n26:56 you can watch a video and then you can\\n26:58 forget after that what they did if you\\n27:00 don't practice it yourself for me it\\n27:03 happens all the time I think I know it\\n27:04 but it's different the knowledge apart\\n27:06 from the skills apart like those things\\n27:08 are different\\n27:13 I know everybody might be very busy but\\n27:18 uh\\n27:19 if they have patience and to slowly\\n27:21 progress every day or whenever they have\\n27:23 time they for sure can make it and\\n27:25 people are very\\n27:28 um yeah flexible on on the deadlines so\\n27:31 you were flexible I was feeling myself\\n27:33 sometimes I was very pressured on the\\n27:35 deadline but okay you said okay let's\\n27:37 extend it one week I don't know maybe I\\n27:40 should say that yeah\\n27:44 um and for sure the final final project\\n27:47 that again as I said before was the the\\n27:50 best thing\\n27:51 I don't know yeah another another thing\\n27:53 uh which I didn't mention that the\\n27:55 community helped me was that you were\\n27:57 mentioning a lot about uh posting your\\n28:00 progress in public or making a post I I\\n28:04 myself I couldn't\\n28:06 post every\\n28:07 every day but uh I was thinking of the\\n28:10 people doing which looked nice but I\\n28:12 posted you know my my final one and uh I\\n28:17 had a lot of requests people sending me\\n28:19 messages to discuss about it so I really\\n28:22 like that as well you know like people\\n28:23 haven't had questions about my project\\n28:26 in the yeah so it was also very\\n28:29 rewarding as well that was pretty cool\\n28:32 and I know that in the course you used\\n28:34 evidently and then I saw you in the\\n28:37 evidently community and I think he also\\n28:39 contributed to the two like how did it\\n28:42 happen can you tell us about that\\n28:44 yeah so I think it was\\n28:46 um I saw the evidently I like the two\\n28:49 and then they announced the hack\\n28:53 Oktoberfest uh for in October\\n28:57 and\\n28:58 um\\n28:59 uh they they they they announced it or\\n29:03 the organization behind it and evidently\\n29:05 itself had some uh issues posted that\\n29:09 you could uh touch solve them and you do\\n29:12 a pull request and yeah I like the tool\\n29:15 like the the whole aspect of it it\\n29:19 fitted you know as I said before in my\\n29:22 uh\\n29:27 um aspect of the yeah of the startup and\\n29:31 uh yeah I said okay well let's let's try\\n29:33 it out I wasn't sure I could\\n29:37 do something useful but yeah this is\\n29:39 something I'm trying to follow it but I\\n29:42 again um it's again I like I like the\\n29:45 community there very much the people\\n29:47 definitely and I'm learning a lot from\\n29:49 there as well\\n29:51 are you still contributing\\n29:53 I try to yeah yeah that is like a small\\n29:55 contribution on a notebook like a like a\\n29:59 how-to you know like recently not\\n30:02 like as a tutorial mostly I'm trying\\n30:05 more to I don't have a lot of time but\\n30:09 uh when I have like I'll try to put it\\n30:11 there\\n30:12 yeah well speaking of having not so much\\n30:15 time well I know you work at a startup\\n30:17 you also take a very active part in our\\n30:20 community then you also contribute to\\n30:23 open source like evidently and he also\\n30:25 freelance so take tell us about that\\n30:27 part like how how did you start\\n30:29 freelancing and what do you do now\\n30:31 as a freelancer yeah so I\\n30:36 um yeah I was doing the I was working on\\n30:38 a startup and I wanted to expose myself\\n30:42 more on data science and Building Things\\n30:45 apart from Gaining the knowledge I want\\n30:47 also some actual\\n30:49 uh uh you know clients on myself for the\\n30:53 data science part just for me to grow\\n30:55 and you know some extra income if I can\\n30:59 and I found this platform called upwork\\n31:03 where\\n31:05 it's a platform that allows Freelancers\\n31:09 apart from it could be data scientists\\n31:11 machine learning Engineers but it could\\n31:12 be some web designer so it's not only\\n31:15 for data\\n31:16 uh reasons uh yeah the platform offers\\n31:19 them a sport to\\n31:23 yeah the refrigerant spot also offers\\n31:25 the same spot for clients so plants post\\n31:28 their their job and clients see those\\n31:31 jobs and they apply all together and see\\n31:34 yeah the client says okay I won't\\n31:37 I like you let's do an interview okay\\n31:40 you're fitted let's start the project\\n31:42 the project could be fixed price or\\n31:45 hourly\\n31:46 there's a lot of competition but it's a\\n31:48 very nice\\n31:50 platform yeah\\n31:52 what kind of projects are there usually\\n31:54 like are they long projects short\\n31:55 projects all all kinds it could be\\n32:01 um I have a niche I check out my\\n32:03 dissertation\\n32:05 uh like for two hours or something and\\n32:09 there could be\\n32:12 um like a six-month project on building\\n32:16 um\\n32:18 like now there I see a lot of llms like\\n32:22 uh you know yeah\\n32:24 LGBT related things what kind of\\n32:27 projects do you usually go after\\n32:29 machine learning data science yeah\\n32:32 analytics those things\\n32:36 yeah those those three those three and\\n32:38 there are a lot of a lot of those and\\n32:41 very diverse like could be from the\\n32:43 healthcare I had the one the big one\\n32:45 from there\\n32:46 and it kind of specs mining it was\\n32:49 and uh yeah there was one for again to\\n32:53 build a model like a\\n32:56 segmentation model I had also won\\n32:59 recently\\n33:02 so like from what I hear it's more like\\n33:06 short-term projects maybe for a week or\\n33:09 a month something like that actually the\\n33:11 yeah the health their Health Care\\n33:13 Project was uh four or three months\\n33:18 um and yeah the the segmentation that I\\n33:22 did was uh three weeks I had one also\\n33:26 give like a it was very short but it\\n33:28 depends like there's I myself couldn't\\n33:31 join because I had the starter green\\n33:33 Journey very very long long one because\\n33:37 I was doing shorter projects like you\\n33:39 can choose to to have like to put more\\n33:43 more than 40 hours per week you know\\n33:46 like it's you can filter out even the\\n33:48 jobs\\n33:49 uh but there are long-term I just have\\n33:52 to help them to choose a certain because\\n33:54 of my the times I can put it\\n33:58 and\\n33:59 Yeah you mentioned that there is a lot\\n34:01 of competition and I imagine that\\n34:02 especially if you're just getting\\n34:04 started at a platform like upwork or\\n34:07 fever or you know there are multiple\\n34:09 there are a few a few of them\\n34:11 like how do you actually get this first\\n34:14 client with all this competition with\\n34:16 all the other Freelancers on this\\n34:18 platform yeah that's a very good\\n34:21 question\\n34:22 um\\n34:24 you have to again have patience that's a\\n34:27 definitely the biggest advice and\\n34:30 persistence so\\n34:33 um you build you do by step by step\\n34:35 first you build like a basic resume or\\n34:39 or the portfolio upwork helps you\\n34:42 artwork wants you to get clients because\\n34:46 even from the business related listen\\n34:47 reasons they get some money out of all\\n34:51 this\\n34:51 so you definitely have the support\\n34:54 kind of from the from the side\\n34:58 um I myself I I had to watch a lot of\\n35:01 you know YouTube videos like people who\\n35:04 are there and had the same or same spot\\n35:06 as me and as the person yeah you ask you\\n35:08 asked\\n35:10 um so I think the first thing is to\\n35:12 build a basic portfolio try some uh do\\n35:15 some\\n35:16 uh\\n35:18 answer some\\n35:21 can find the word yeah uh clients judge\\n35:24 you know go to try to take them post as\\n35:29 as beautiful as you can why you want the\\n35:31 job or what you can do about it if they\\n35:34 reject you it's fine try to get to learn\\n35:36 from it why why it happened\\n35:38 and uh yeah kind of improve step by step\\n35:42 and for me it helped a lot again this to\\n35:45 have this process like I didn't get a\\n35:47 job any in the beginning any job then I\\n35:50 found out okay I should write a better\\n35:52 message to them trying to explain\\n35:53 exactly what I can do for them and then\\n35:56 I built like I was sending them apart\\n35:59 from my message they they can you can\\n36:01 present attachment okay I didn't use\\n36:03 that attachment okay I built a\\n36:05 PowerPoint\\n36:06 I was all the process that I've done\\n36:08 myself\\n36:10 um not to want to have to do with a\\n36:12 natural client like I I had actually the\\n36:14 mlops project that I did\\n36:17 uh from foreign\\n36:21 and uh I had it attached in my message\\n36:24 so in the end\\n36:27 um and by proving again every maybe day\\n36:30 every week your\\n36:31 um your profile you have you get higher\\n36:34 chances you might not get get the best\\n36:37 client in the beginning but if you get a\\n36:39 small job\\n36:40 you get might get five stars you know\\n36:42 okay you didn't get much fun but uh you\\n36:45 get the five stars then you get another\\n36:46 five stars maybe then you can you know\\n36:48 climb more and more so it's a\\n36:54 you have to put your time to invest and\\n36:57 have patience but it's again I think\\n36:59 could be rewarding\\n37:00 from what I heard it looks like the\\n37:02 course helped you actually get inclined\\n37:05 yeah yeah it helped it helped okay good\\n37:09 happy to hear that so you said that\\n37:13 um you were constantly improving and\\n37:15 trying to figure out why rejections\\n37:17 happened\\n37:18 so why do you think rejections actually\\n37:20 happen because your profile wasn't\\n37:22 complete because the clients were unsure\\n37:24 that you can do the job or what was the\\n37:26 reason\\n37:27 yeah\\n37:28 yeah so\\n37:30 some\\n37:33 uh most of the yeah somebody else if\\n37:36 somebody else gets a job yeah maybe\\n37:39 um another person had the written a\\n37:42 better\\n37:44 um I cannot sign again this kind of the\\n37:46 word for that\\n37:49 sorry cover letter portfolio yeah the\\n37:51 cover letter exactly it's like yeah it\\n37:53 may be written and cover letter or had\\n37:55 more fitted job uh\\n37:59 yeah our skills about that or had more\\n38:02 experience or maybe they they were less\\n38:06 money so I think it depends I think it\\n38:09 always helps maybe that's maybe\\n38:11 something I didn't say before to have a\\n38:13 specific skill\\n38:15 maybe like three years or sorry um one\\n38:19 year ago seeing a lot of chatbots people\\n38:21 if so if you had a very good experience\\n38:23 on building chatbots you can focus only\\n38:26 on that and then you get some clients\\n38:28 there that helps a lot I wasn't kind of\\n38:30 that person\\n38:32 uh so for me yeah I you don't get\\n38:36 exactly the the feedback you have to ask\\n38:38 or it's from clients if you don't get an\\n38:41 answer you can again make assumptions\\n38:42 but I was saying always this YouTube\\n38:45 videos or the instructions or the\\n38:47 advices they are was giving and I I was\\n38:50 seeing myself\\n38:52 yeah I was not writing a good uh cover\\n38:54 letter yeah I I maybe asked for two\\n38:58 months so yeah I have to check I have to\\n39:00 put more skills for my\\n39:02 resume\\n39:03 so yeah\\n39:06 was it worth it like it looks like you\\n39:09 went through a lot of troubles to\\n39:10 actually start getting clients like do\\n39:12 you enjoy it\\n39:14 yeah yeah so it wasn't that the\\n39:18 I was doing only that so\\n39:22 again for me it was a learning\\n39:24 experience from the beginning so I\\n39:26 enjoyed it and also like you get the\\n39:32 um some kind of angry not exactly angry\\n39:35 that's okay why I'm not getting where I\\n39:37 want like what I'm missing so\\n39:39 it's kind of uh building uh building up\\n39:43 until you get a success so kinda you get\\n39:47 a push to be to develop better to\\n39:49 develop yourself better yeah yeah\\n39:52 okay cool\\n39:55 um so now in addition to your uh\\n39:58 to work at the startup you have a few\\n40:01 extra gigs that you do at upwork right\\n40:05 yeah yeah yeah right uh you just\\n40:07 finished one recently with uh with the\\n40:10 one that the segmentation\\n40:12 that I was talking about uh yeah but now\\n40:15 I like I don't have any\\n40:17 I've heard that one of the problems with\\n40:19 upwork and that are similar platforms is\\n40:22 that there are a lot of people who work\\n40:25 for very little money\\n40:27 and then you kind of have to compete\\n40:30 with them how did you solve this problem\\n40:31 like how do you do you come up how do\\n40:33 you come up with the price for your\\n40:35 offers for your projects\\n40:38 yeah\\n40:40 um I'm not able to answer this exactly\\n40:44 this is indeed an issue\\n40:46 um I myself have put it a\\n40:49 like an hourly you know 43 dollars per\\n40:53 hour and\\n40:55 um I'm trying to follow that as much as\\n40:58 I can depending on the project if the\\n41:00 project is not going to take a lot of\\n41:02 time for me I might\\n41:04 and it's not very complicated I might\\n41:06 lower it\\n41:08 um if it's a good big Corporation I will\\n41:10 definitely put it like that so again it\\n41:13 sorry depends on the client secondly\\n41:15 secondly depends on\\n41:18 again me valuing my time so I I have my\\n41:22 kind of income from the startup\\n41:24 and uh I'm okay so I have a kind of a\\n41:28 basic salary so again the question is\\n41:30 this rest of the time that I have\\n41:33 how much I value it if I value it very\\n41:38 like a 10 dollars per hour for a project\\n41:42 that uh is not gonna offer me something\\n41:45 new like a new\\n41:47 skills then I'm not gonna accept if it's\\n41:51 10 hours then then dollars per hour\\n41:54 again the same but it's something that's\\n41:55 going to give me definitely nice skills\\n41:57 and I really like it I might do it if it\\n42:00 is very good money I will uh yeah again\\n42:03 gonna do it so it depends on how how I\\n42:07 buy you my time\\n42:09 it's personal\\n42:11 so\\n42:14 um you are now at up work and you see a\\n42:18 nice project then you probably I don't\\n42:20 know apply to this project you send a\\n42:22 cover letter you sent the PowerPoint\\n42:24 presentation and then you come up with a\\n42:27 price depending on the type of the\\n42:29 client\\n42:30 and what what happens next\\n42:32 after apply like\\n42:34 yeah so that's a yeah indeed a very\\n42:37 interesting uh part of the process that\\n42:41 um\\n42:42 so after that you get you might have\\n42:45 already done an interview to get\\n42:47 accepted but then it starts another\\n42:48 process of okay starting with the\\n42:50 project\\n42:51 uh all the clients problem\\n42:55 um and there my personally saying that I\\n42:58 have to make sure that the tasks for\\n43:02 getting\\n43:04 in the final solution or the Milestone\\n43:08 at least that has been decided is clicks\\n43:10 are clear\\n43:11 or as lesser clear as it can be\\n43:15 so I'm trying to I'm trying to talk with\\n43:18 a client and again it depending on the\\n43:20 client like if it's a big Corporation\\n43:21 it's more easy to do that it's a it's an\\n43:23 only person alone it's more difficult\\n43:25 but uh after the the interview the first\\n43:30 interview or the you have getting\\n43:32 accepted you have to\\n43:34 um maybe do a kind of an inspection or\\n43:36 call we can call sometimes data\\n43:39 inspection and see okay what do they\\n43:40 have uh is it true what they had there\\n43:43 was they were saying is indeed the data\\n43:46 that they were saying okay\\n43:48 um I see I I take some time and see okay\\n43:50 can I solve it\\n43:52 um in the way that they asked or do we\\n43:57 have to\\n43:58 uh tell them how I'm gonna I'm gonna\\n44:00 solve it so you do this kind of more\\n44:03 theoretical\\n44:04 and less practical parts and uh you both\\n44:08 agree you have to both agree with your\\n44:10 stakeholder or the other client and then\\n44:12 you start doing the actual task and\\n44:15 while you're doing again the tasks you\\n44:17 have to make some Milestones okay I did\\n44:19 that where we are do we like it let's\\n44:21 move on and so it's a another kind of\\n44:25 first\\n44:26 looks like similar to what we talked\\n44:28 about in the lean uh about this yeah\\n44:31 right\\n44:32 yeah yeah yeah it's philosophy it's\\n44:36 immense\\n44:37 so you just work in Milestones then you\\n44:41 see if the client is satisfied with what\\n44:43 you do and if they are you continue\\n44:45 working so then you get constant\\n44:47 feedback from them right\\n44:49 yeah yeah yeah\\n44:49 that's you always what you want to do\\n44:52 it's more I can say it more easy that I\\n44:55 can do it myself there are always some\\n44:58 things you know unpredictable but it's\\n45:00 okay\\n45:01 and uh yeah I I failed sometimes myself\\n45:05 like doing this kind of process and I\\n45:07 try to improve it every time\\n45:10 yeah\\n45:12 and two in order to work as a freelancer\\n45:15 you needed to register a company or how\\n45:17 does it work ah yeah yeah so\\n45:20 yeah you have to be\\n45:22 um\\n45:24 I tried to translate it in uh from grip\\n45:26 uh like\\n45:28 um\\n45:29 uh yeah you have to register as a\\n45:32 freelancer for your own uh country\\n45:37 so when you get that kind of income you\\n45:40 can say okay you have to put an invoice\\n45:42 and uh publish it I don't know kind of\\n45:46 thing the in the country and so they can\\n45:49 bring the taxes\\n45:52 um\\n45:52 so yeah you don't just you know start\\n45:56 go to upwork register and start early in\\n45:59 the money right so there is some yeah\\n46:01 yeah yeah you have to like okay maybe\\n46:05 maybe you can do it and never get the\\n46:08 money in your bank and put it always put\\n46:10 it you can stay always in the app on the\\n46:12 upwork I don't know if you want that\\n46:14 entire thread or so sorry\\n46:17 so if the money is in upwork then like\\n46:22 what are you going to do with this money\\n46:24 yeah I don't know I don't know what's\\n46:26 happening like you can actually put it\\n46:29 there until you I don't know\\n46:31 uh maybe maybe you can do it and then\\n46:34 start a company on your own to get them\\n46:37 in your bank first you try to get a few\\n46:39 clients and if this thing works out then\\n46:41 you go through the paperwork so you\\n46:44 don't have to but immediately off the\\n46:46 platform yeah maybe you or you can do\\n46:48 them in parallel because they're doing\\n46:50 the paperwork maybe take some time\\n46:52 depending on where you are\\n46:54 you know like uh you can take\\n46:57 some delays you know there is a public\\n47:01 sector things\\n47:03 so it's your work you have to wear\\n47:06 multiple hats so we talked about many\\n47:08 different things you need to like talk\\n47:10 to clients uh maybe even do videos and\\n47:13 all that kind of stuff while here as a\\n47:16 freelancer you you are more focused on\\n47:19 machine learning right\\n47:23 you still need to do some extra stuff\\n47:27 I think again the communication students\\n47:30 the the whole process that I described\\n47:33 made the if you had like a good soft\\n47:37 maybe skills but say it better it will\\n47:40 help you because as you might have a\\n47:42 person again you have to control the the\\n47:45 whole process with the client\\n47:47 and also present them what you did with\\n47:51 maybe you don't have to maybe a lot of\\n47:53 technical\\n47:56 um yeah so again this kind of skills are\\n47:59 very\\n48:00 uh very viable and and I think you can\\n48:04 again connect it with everything like\\n48:05 again business\\n48:07 you you are a business or your own there\\n48:09 and I was thinking about how value your\\n48:12 time and you have to decide that so you\\n48:14 maybe have to kind of get again the the\\n48:18 business knowledge for yourself\\n48:24 these are skills that you can learn them\\n48:26 along the way\\n48:28 and\\n48:29 yeah you can you can do some failures\\n48:32 and you can learn from them I think\\n48:35 again if somebody listens to this\\n48:37 podcast uh podcast and make a checklist\\n48:40 again it's not very easy to track with\\n48:43 all of these things unless you as you\\n48:45 you do them\\n48:47 you know so uh again if somebody wants\\n48:51 to I think you asked before it just\\n48:53 won't start just go for it and\\n48:57 it would be viable for sure\\n49:00 you get some good skills\\n49:02 thank you there's a question from\\n49:04 Anonymous I struggled to get freelance\\n49:07 work other than being consistent in the\\n49:09 search for freelance work do you have\\n49:11 any other suggestions\\n49:13 I think we discussed this partly so like\\n49:16 iterate improve your profile right that\\n49:19 was one of the things\\n49:21 um\\n49:21 is there anything else you would\\n49:23 recommend to the anonymous person\\n49:25 well I didn't I didn't answer the second\\n49:27 part like um\\n49:29 yeah so the question is I struggle to\\n49:31 get freelance work other than being\\n49:34 consistent in the search for freelance\\n49:36 work do you have any other suggestions\\n49:40 I can see\\n49:44 um um\\n49:46 I think it can be a good idea while you\\n49:51 are\\n49:53 see okay see what is valuable for the\\n49:56 client all right\\n49:59 um okay searching uh and and for you to\\n50:02 get a job so doing consistent and\\n50:04 persistent way of uh yeah doing a lot of\\n50:07 uh taking a lot of jobs it will help you\\n50:10 um the other thing which I said uh fix\\n50:13 your profile every day try to see where\\n50:16 you can improve like if you can improve\\n50:19 your profile every day by little in one\\n50:21 month you can have very good profile\\n50:24 um I think you can also while you're\\n50:26 doing that see where\\n50:28 um you want to focus your skills or\\n50:32 um whether you want to learn something\\n50:34 new and while you doing this search also\\n50:38 learn a skill or improve your skill\\n50:41 skill set that's also very valuable\\n50:46 and\\n50:49 yeah check for sure the YouTube videos\\n50:52 and tutorials from other people in the\\n50:54 network Community they they will help\\n50:56 you definitely\\n50:58 uh you can follow their advices and yeah\\n51:01 like while you're doing the skills maybe\\n51:02 you can build you know uh like I did a\\n51:06 project\\n51:07 from in the mlops\\n51:10 uh course and uh\\n51:12 put it on your GitHub\\n51:16 and then put it on your presentation you\\n51:19 know and attach to it when in your next\\n51:24 um cover letter\\n51:27 those things I can think right now\\n51:29 so we're struggling with getting upward\\n51:33 clients do our courses and do projects\\n51:35 in our courses right and then\\n51:39 yes hello project\\n51:42 cool thanks uh\\n51:44 yeah so maybe coming back to what he do\\n51:47 at Daily Talk slab this is something I\\n51:49 wanted to talk at the end well we\\n51:51 mentioned already you took part in our\\n51:54 courses\\n51:55 you also recently finished the date\\n51:57 engineering course right yeah\\n52:00 so did like it yeah I I liked it and\\n52:03 there were some skills that I wanted to\\n52:08 I really liked it\\n52:10 um\\n52:11 I didn't have an exposure a lot you know\\n52:14 to streaming and I wanted a lot of focus\\n52:17 on that in uh in this in this one\\n52:23 um\\n52:24 it's also yeah for the final project I I\\n52:28 use the Kafka Co fluent actually\\n52:32 and yeah I think\\n52:35 uh I would totally\\n52:38 recommend to it to anyone uh\\n52:41 this course I really liked you know the\\n52:44 the document that you had you had the\\n52:47 secret document with uh answers you know\\n52:51 questions that people had or uh and\\n52:54 frequently asked a question yeah\\n52:58 that saved a lot of a lot of time like\\n53:01 it was amazing how many times I had the\\n53:04 same issue\\n53:07 um and I think it's not easy easy to\\n53:08 make like a debt engineering of course\\n53:11 because a lot of technical little things\\n53:13 aspects or versions change as you go you\\n53:17 know\\n53:18 yeah but um\\n53:21 I yeah it was uh it was very valuable\\n53:25 thing to do\\n53:28 what your project was about you said he\\n53:30 mentioned it was streaming but what kind\\n53:32 of project it also sound like\\n53:35 semiconductor no no the um I wanted\\n53:38 actually to go to come to send you like\\n53:41 uh maybe to\\n53:43 we make something valuable\\n53:47 so I tried in the beginning to try to\\n53:49 use Twitter the API\\n53:52 but I I was saying that I had I was\\n53:55 taking a lot of time to get accepted as\\n53:57 a developer there I don't know why is\\n54:00 the reason maybe some people do it\\n54:01 faster but I couldn't myself so I said\\n54:04 okay\\n54:05 um and I was supposed to take uh I\\n54:08 wanted to do uh to take to scrape\\n54:11 Twitter and specifically people were\\n54:13 talking about data talks club and\\n54:14 somehow uses data\\n54:16 and that's okay I can I cannot do that\\n54:18 so I went to the YouTube videos\\n54:21 and uh I was saying okay maybe I can do\\n54:23 something about that\\n54:25 so I took the YouTube API and I saw\\n54:29 actually a video from a\\n54:33 um somebody called Chris Jenkins I think\\n54:36 who was using the YouTube API and from\\n54:38 playlist\\n54:39 and she was taking the mathematics from\\n54:43 the videos number of comments number of\\n54:45 views all these and he was streaming to\\n54:49 a telegram I don't know he was when\\n54:51 there was something he knew a comment\\n54:54 will appear so I said okay I will use\\n54:56 kind of the same logic but I will put it\\n54:59 on a bigquery\\n55:02 and stream every like every second every\\n55:05 some seconds the uh the number of views\\n55:08 the comments and and the likes and\\n55:14 stream them in the dashboards\\n55:16 in uh from the big way to a house called\\n55:21 um\\n55:22 the dashboard that you can look at yeah\\n55:25 and put it on Locker and I that was a\\n55:28 streaming part and there was also like\\n55:30 other metrics that came as a batch you\\n55:35 know I didn't have to in my head okay\\n55:36 maybe it's not useful to put in a stream\\n55:38 maybe you can do it every\\n55:40 um schedule it for every day or yeah say\\n55:43 like a daily and it was another pipeline\\n55:47 um\\n55:48 yeah again there are struggles uh\\n55:50 struggle but it was useful uh but it was\\n55:52 it was funny but in the NBA in the end\\n55:56 the YouTube didn't allow me to use the\\n55:59 API for one more uh than uh I don't know\\n56:03 100 times per day so it was a bummer\\n56:05 couldn't uh make it in the end something\\n56:08 what I wanted but yeah it was a\\n56:12 again I took the tools that you had in\\n56:14 each video and to make something the key\\n56:16 that I wanted\\n56:19 yeah that sounds so cool\\n56:21 so like maybe for those who are\\n56:24 struggling with coming up with a\\n56:26 portfolio project because it's important\\n56:28 for freelance job or for those who are\\n56:30 now listening to this and taking the\\n56:33 course right now and they're struggling\\n56:35 with coming up with a project idea do\\n56:37 you have any recommendations for them\\n56:40 yeah find something that you personally\\n56:43 like\\n56:45 and um\\n56:46 try to see if there is a data about that\\n56:51 and if there maybe you can build like if\\n56:54 you see the engineering project the\\n56:55 dashboard or if it's a machine learning\\n56:57 envelopes like a\\n56:59 model and it's if it is it don't have to\\n57:03 be perfect like definitely not to be\\n57:05 perfect you just try make sure that you\\n57:09 have this nice idea that you like\\n57:11 and it will definitely\\n57:13 make you more eager and you're gonna\\n57:16 join more uh the whole thing the whole\\n57:20 building process\\n57:22 yeah yeah well if I don't know what I\\n57:24 like\\n57:25 yeah so that's um another philosophical\\n57:29 uh I think you should come go out there\\n57:32 and explore\\n57:34 uh maybe join yeah join a startup join\\n57:39 the corporate maybe do a break and try\\n57:41 to see what you're passionate about\\n57:43 um\\n57:44 explore like if it would be\\n57:47 reinforcement\\n57:52 explore part\\n57:54 okay well I guess we should be wrapping\\n57:58 up so maybe last question for you\\n58:00 do you have any resource recommendations\\n58:03 for anyone who is listening to this I\\n58:05 think you mentioned the Lean Startup\\n58:07 book maybe you have some other\\n58:09 recommendations yeah I I would\\n58:12 definitely again recommend people really\\n58:14 reading Lean Startup it will help them\\n58:16 either in startup or not\\n58:19 other whole idea of what process of\\n58:22 working\\n58:23 so I would recommend that book for data\\n58:26 scientists and then the machine learning\\n58:29 Engineers analysts I would recommend\\n58:31 also like a second part of it called\\n58:34 um lean Analytics\\n58:36 where is focusing a lot on the\\n58:40 measure part\\n58:42 and making up every building and finding\\n58:45 a good metrics\\n58:47 for your startup your project or yeah\\n58:51 whether you're you're doing uh it's it's\\n58:54 a 10 years ago that book but some a lot\\n58:58 of out of the parts are up to date\\n59:00 and the I think the the writers are\\n59:03 updating it\\n59:05 and um\\n59:07 I I would recommend also a book\\n59:12 um here\\n59:15 no I I'm not sure yeah I really like\\n59:19 this book now that I'm kind of finishing\\n59:21 the designing machine learning systems\\n59:24 yeah it looked uh very nice it's a book\\n59:28 by chip yeah cheap\\n59:31 yeah see I cannot pronounce it\\n59:34 yeah I will not attempts your last name\\n59:36 too so yeah and\\n59:40 um yeah check out the data talks love\\n59:43 thank you\\n59:44 yeah yeah we should be wrapping up\\n59:47 thanks\\n59:49 uh join us today for sharing all your\\n59:51 experience and thanks for being a very\\n59:54 active member of our community and\\n59:55 thanks everyone for joining us today too\\n59:57 and listening\\n59:59 so I guess that's all have a great week\\n1:00:02 YouTube\"}"
